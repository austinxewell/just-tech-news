  # Description

  # Installation
  To use the web application you will need to clone the repository from my GitHub link at: https://github.com/austinxewell/just-tech-news. This application does not have a deployed link and will need to be ran locally. You can start the server by using "npm start" in the terminal. Once you are connected to the server and the database you are then able to create a user, log in, and run the application.
  # Usage
  To use the web application you will need to follow the installation process. Once the application is installed in your local machine you will be able to create and account, log in, and then browse the application. Keep in mind, this is a bare bones application designed for testing my skills and not functionality. Once you have created a user the page will not refresh or log you in, you will need to log in with your created credientials. Since this is not deployed and stored locally, you will need to create your own posts to view data.
